# Artemis: Python-Based Commodity Trading Bot

**Artemis** is a momentum-based algorithmic trading bot built in Python that analyzes crude oil price movements using technical indicators. It identifies buy/sell signals based on RSI and moving average crossovers, visualizes trades, and backtests performance on historical data.

## Strategy Overview

- **Buy Signal:**
  - RSI < 30 (oversold)
  - 10-day Moving Average crosses **above** 30-day Moving Average

- **Sell Signal:**
  - RSI > 70 (overbought)
  - 10-day MA crosses **below** 30-day MA

This dual-confirmation system attempts to catch early momentum reversals.
